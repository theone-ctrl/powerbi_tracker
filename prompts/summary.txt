Based on the following list of summarized Power BI ideas, analyze and extract the following insights:

1. **User Pain Points** – What common challenges or frustrations do users face?
2. **User Needs** – What are users ultimately trying to achieve or improve?
3. **What's Missing** – What functionalities, features, or support are currently lacking in Power BI?
4. **Recommended Solution Directions** – What changes, improvements, or additions would best address the gaps and user expectations?

Focus on clarity and theme-level insights rather than summarizing each idea again. Be concise and insightful.

Return your output strictly in the following JSON format:

{
  "painPoints": "string",
  "needs": "string",
  "missing": "string",
  "solutions": "string"
}
